# There can be development actions

Create a chunk with 'development' actions

- The chunk needs to be named `development` or `dev`
- It contains functions that are used for package development only
- Note that you may want to store most of these functions in the 0-dev_history.Rmd file

These are only included in the present flat template file, their content will not be part of the package anywhere else.
